# Prometheus Parquet Library (WIP)

**Status: ðŸš§ Very early stage â€“ expect breaking changes and rapid iteration**

---

This project aims to provide a **shared Go library** for working with **Parquet**-encoded time series data across Prometheus-related projects such as [Cortex](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex) and [Thanos](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos).

## Goal

The core objective is to define a **common Parquet schema** and implement **encoding/decoding logic** that can be reused to:

- Export and query time series data in a Parquet format.
- Enable more efficient and scalable long-term storage in object stores like S3, GCS, and Azure Blob.
- Reduce duplication across projects that are independently experimenting with Parquet-based storage.

## Current Status

This repository is in a **very early phase**. We're still experimenting with the schema design, low-level encoding strategies, and how this can plug into Cortex, Thanos, or other Prometheus-compatible systems.

Expect:

- Rapid changes in structure and API
- Incomplete or unstable features
- Minimal documentation

## Planned Features

- Reusable Go types for time series + metadata
- Parquet schema definitions (with logical type hints for efficiency)
- High-performance encoders/decoders
- Utilities for block indexing and  querying
- Test data generators for benchmarking

## Contributions

Ideas, feedback, and code contributions are welcome â€” but please note that the design is still in flux. If you're interested in contributing, feel free to open an issue or discussion.
